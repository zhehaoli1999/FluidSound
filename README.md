# FluidSound

Bubble-based water sound synthesis code based on the papers:
    
> [Improved Water Sound Synthesis using Coupled Bubbles](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/coupledbubbles/). Kangrui Xue, Ryan M. Aronson, Jui-Hsien Wang, Timothy R. Langlois, Doug L. James. *ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH North America 2023)*.  

> [Toward Animating Water with Complex Acoustic Bubbles](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Sound/bubbles/). Timothy R. Langlois, Changxi Zheng, Doug L. James. *ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH North America 2016)*. 

## Build Instructions

**Dependencies:** C++11, Eigen 3.4

Building is handled by CMake. For example, to build from source on Mac & Linux:

    git clone https://github.com/kangruix/FluidSound
    cd FluidSound
    mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make -j4

We provide an example scene in Scenes/GlassPour/. To run the code:

    ./runFluidSound ../Scenes/GlassPour/trackedBubInfo.txt 48000 1
    python ../scripts/write_wav.py output.txt 48000

With importance filtering (full graph + filtered subset for output):

    ./runFluidSound <full_bub_file> <filtered_bub_file> 48000 1 -o output_filtered.txt

Optional `-o`/`--output` sets the waveform output file (default: output.txt).

The full file provides the complete merge/split graph; the filtered file lists which bubbles contribute to the final sound. Bubbles not in the filtered set still participate in coupling but their contribution is excluded from the output. 

(where the 1 indicates the scheme: 0 - uncoupled, 1 - coupled). Afterwards, the simulated audio will be written to 'output.wav'. More scenes are available [here](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/waveblender/dataset/index.html).
